**Had a long gap as I was procrastinating and managing myself, do reach out to me and let's connect and learn together by motivating eachother as I love people who learn in peer**

Interesting Article I read today about using Notion to organise Programming topics: https://blog.damiandemasi.com/using-notion-to-organise-programming-topics

### started again with Abdul Bari DSA course<br>
<i>Here, I have taken notes from the letures I watch</i> <br>

- Main Memory is divided into 3 section i.e. code section, stack and heap
-heap memory is external to the program so for that to access we need pointer example if we want to access a file from hard disk then we need a pointer for accessing such file. So pointers are used for:
	1. Accessing Heap
	2. Accessing other resources
	3. Parameter Passing
	
- In C, if we declare a variable using malloc then it get's stored in Heap
- size of the pointer is independent to the datatype used so whatever pointer we use they occupy same no. of bytes depending upon the compiler
- reference is the nickname/ alias/ another name given to a variable which is there is c++

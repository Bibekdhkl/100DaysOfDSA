## Day06
- tried doing few [problems of sorting](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sort-in-specific-order2422/1/?category[]=Arrays&category[]=Arrays&problemType=functional&difficulty[]=-1&page=2&sortBy=accuracy&query=category[]ArraysproblemTypefunctionaldifficulty[]-1page2sortByaccuracycategory[]Arrays) on gfg but couldn't do that 
- Also fixed some issues of java package on Ubuntu
- Studied the basics of LinkedList as that's on going on my collge course

### Thoughts
- don't shift here and there while browsing
- Do one thing at a time while learning too, I guess I need to start pomodoro technique during my dsa jouney
- I have been writing it at 2:17AM which is not good to stay up this late :X

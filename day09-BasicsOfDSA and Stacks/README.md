## Day09 -Basic theories of DSA

- Data structure are way to organize data in logical models
- Algorithms use the data structure to store or retrieve the data to accomplish certain tasks

### Operations in Data Structures
1. Traversing  : Going through all elements of DS(Data Structure) eg. while counting total no. of odd number in a array, we need to traverse through all elements
2. Searching : finding an item in data
3. Inserting : Adding data item into DS
4. Deleting
5. Sorting : Arranging data in particular order such as alphabetical, numeircal
6. Merging : combining two differrent data structure

### ADT(Abstract Data Type)
- Just like a feature abstraction in OOP, here ADT is a set of data values and associated operations which does not provide implementation detail.
- Example: when we declare a variable of type int then we don't need to understand how ints are represented nor how it's operation like addition, divison is implemented so type int is ADT.

### Stacks
- Stack is linear data structure in which insertion and deletion can only be done from one end
- Used to maintain browser history
- Stack is called ADT as its operations push,pop... doesn't depend upon only one types of Data i.e we can do these operations by STL
- Follows LIFO(Last In First Out) scheme like Arranging plates one after another
